        <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h1>
        <p>
          Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led
          by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as
          eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and
          services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many
          others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience
          for many consumers.

        <h1>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p>
          Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
          growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
          businesses wishing to use their website to sell and services to
          customers. [1] There is open source software for web development like
          BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and
          Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a
          minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has
          been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as
          Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge
          of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is
          still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and
          implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books,
          internet tutorials or training or face-to-face training. An ever
          growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build
          more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now
          help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally
          only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has
          allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media
          distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services
          such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These web
          services allow users to interact with applications from many
          locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their
          application environment.
