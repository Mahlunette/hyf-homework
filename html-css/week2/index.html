          Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led
          by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as
          eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and
          services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many
          others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience
          for many consumers.

          Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
          growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
          businesses wishing to use their website to sell and services to
          customers. [1] <br />

          There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB,
          GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This
          has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another
          contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of
          easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe
          Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of
          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still
          required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and
          implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books,
          internet tutorials or training or face-to-face training. <br />
          An ever growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers
          build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers
          now help to deliver applications as web services which were
          traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer.
          This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information
          and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud
          services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These
          web services allow users to interact with applications from many
          locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their
          application environment.
