Stuffed Grape Leaves (Dolmas)
Stuffed grape leaves, also known as dolmas or dolmades, are arguably the most iconic Mediterranean food out there.

Homemade dolmas are one of my personal favorites, they will always remind me of my mother's Mediterranean kitchen. I first learned to make them as a young teen in my mother's Egyptian kitchen. It's the sort of food that's more fun to make in groups. So, the ladies of the family would gather around our small kitchen table, stuffing and rolling grape leaves, while catching up on life. Great memories!
